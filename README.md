# Surfs Up!

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area.

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. All of the following analysis is completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Use SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to the sqlite database.

* Use SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect the tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query to find the most active stations.

  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Which station has the highest number of observations?

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).

  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

After completed the initial analysis, we design a Flask API based on the queries that we have just developed.

* Use FLASK to create the routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a Dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of the dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * query for the dates and temperature observations from a year from the last data point.
  * Return a JSON list of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.

* Use Flask `jsonify` to convert your API data into a valid JSON response object.
